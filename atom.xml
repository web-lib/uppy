    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi! We are back with yet another Uppy release that contains some often requested features such as file restrictions and better file type detection, alongside a brand new Instagram plugin, UI improvements and more!</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="‚ö†Ô∏è-File-Restrictions"><a href="#‚ö†Ô∏è-File-Restrictions" class="headerlink" title="‚ö†Ô∏è File Restrictions"></a>‚ö†Ô∏è File Restrictions</h2><p>Something that a few of our biggest fans were asking for, is finally here! Here‚Äôs the gist of it:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">Uppy(&#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">debug</span>: <span class="literal">true</span>,</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">autoProceed</span>: <span class="literal">false</span>,</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">restrictions</span>: &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="attr">maxFileSize</span>: <span class="number">300000</span>,</div><div class="line">    <span class="attr">maxNumberOfFiles</span>: <span class="number">5</span>,</div><div class="line">    <span class="attr">minNumberOfFiles</span>: <span class="number">2</span>,</div><div class="line">    <span class="attr">allowedFileTypes</span>: [<span class="string">'image/*'</span>, <span class="string">'video/*'</span>]</div><div class="line">  &#125;,</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">onBeforeFileAdded</span>: <span class="function">(<span class="params">currentFile, files</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (currentFile.name === <span class="string">'my-file.jpg'</span>) &#123;</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="built_in">Promise</span>.resolve()</div><div class="line">    &#125;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="built_in">Promise</span>.reject(<span class="string">'This is not the file I was looking for'</span>)</div><div class="line">  &#125;,</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">onBeforeUpload</span>: <span class="function">(<span class="params">files</span>) =&gt;</span> &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">if</span> (<span class="built_in">Object</span>.keys(files).length &lt; <span class="number">2</span>) &#123;</div><div class="line">      <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="built_in">Promise</span>.reject(<span class="string">'Too few files :('</span>)</div><div class="line">    &#125;</div><div class="line">    <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="built_in">Promise</span>.resolve()</div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Basically, there are two ways to set restrictions:</p>
<p>1. Using the <code>restrictions</code> object in Uppy‚Äôs core settings:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">restrictions: &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">maxFileSize</span>: <span class="number">300000</span>,</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">maxNumberOfFiles</span>: <span class="number">5</span>,</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">minNumberOfFiles</span>: <span class="number">2</span>,</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">allowedFileTypes</span>: [<span class="string">'image/*'</span>, <span class="string">'video/*'</span>]</div><div class="line">&#125;</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>Translation: allow only images and videos of any type, a minimum of 2 and maximum of 5 files must be selected, 300kb or less.</p>
<p><code>allowedFileTypes</code> must be an array of strings with supported file mime-types. Anything from <a href="https://www.iana.org/assignments/media-types/media-types.xhtml" target="_blank" rel="external">this list</a> should work, as long as Uppy is able to detect it (and Uppy promises to try real hard, see below for details). Both wildcards <code>video/*</code> and specicifc types <code>image/jpeg</code> are supported!</p>
<p>2. Using the more advanced callbacks: <code>onBeforeFileAdded(currentFile, files)</code>, which fires before a file is added and allows you to run whatever checks you wish against either the single file that is about to be added or all files currently selected / uploaded, and <code>onBeforeUpload(files)</code>, where you are able to check stuff before proceeding with the upload.</p>
<p>Basically, use the first option for the simple stuff such as limiting uploads to images or a maximum of three files. Use the second option for things like ‚Äúwe need users to upload 5 photos and an audio file, so we can make a short clip out of it‚Äù. Let us know if this suits your needs, we are all üëÇearsüëÇ!</p>
<p>Also, a new <code>note</code> option has been added to the Dashboard, as a quick and easy way to inform users about the restrictions you choose to set up:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">uppy.use(Dashboard, &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">note</span>: <span class="string">'Images and video only, 300kb or less'</span></div><div class="line">&#125;)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/blog/0.17/restrictions-note.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="üì∏-Instagram-plugin-and-UI-overhaul"><a href="#üì∏-Instagram-plugin-and-UI-overhaul" class="headerlink" title="üì∏ Instagram plugin and UI overhaul"></a>üì∏ Instagram plugin and UI overhaul</h2><p>Yes, Instagram is now supported in Uppy, so you can easily import all of your cat, dog and food pictures!</p>
<figure class="wide"><br>  <img class="border" src="/images/blog/0.17/instagram-ui.jpg"><br></figure>

<p>You can try it live in the <a href="https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/">Dashboard example</a>.</p>
<p>The UI for all ‚Äúprovider‚Äù plugins, which is the way we call Google Drive, Dropbox and other external services, have been revamped to make better use of the space.</p>
<p>Files are now selected, or added, on click/tap, rather than double click, which is easier and also works on mobile. üôÄ</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/blog/0.17/provider-search.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="StatusBar"><a href="#StatusBar" class="headerlink" title="StatusBar"></a>StatusBar</h2><p>The Dashboard‚Äôs StatusBar has been improved. First of all, even though it still comes bundled with the Dashboard like before, it is now a separate plugin that can be used anywhere, like with the Drag and Drop plugin or your own custom thing. Furthermore, it now shows fatal upload errors in addition to the upload / processing / transcoding progress. üí™</p>
<p>In the Dashboard, you can now disable the StatusBar and/or Informer if you don‚Äôt need them or want something custom, by setting <code>disableStatusBar: true</code> and <code>disableInformer: true</code>.</p>
<p>Details: <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/217" target="_blank" rel="external">#217</a></p>
<h2 id="Better-file-type-detection"><a href="#Better-file-type-detection" class="headerlink" title="Better file type detection"></a>Better file type detection</h2><p>We‚Äôve added a <a href="https://github.com/sindresorhus/file-type" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>file-type</code></a> module that helps with figuring out the file type by reading the first magic bytes of the file. If that doesn‚Äôt work, we try to use the mime-type provided by the system/browser, and if that is still a dead end, we attempt to figure it out by extension. All in all, this leads to a more robust file type detecting experience. Personally, I‚Äôm just happy my Sex and the City üç∏ <code>.avi</code> files are now recognized as <code>video</code> on a Mac! </p>
<p>Further details can be found here: <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/219" target="_blank" rel="external">#219</a></p>
<h2 id="Extracting-metadata-from-lt-form-gt-inputs"><a href="#Extracting-metadata-from-lt-form-gt-inputs" class="headerlink" title="Extracting metadata from &lt;form&gt; inputs"></a>Extracting metadata from <code>&lt;form&gt;</code> inputs</h2><p>If a plugin‚Äôs <code>target</code> is a <code>form</code> element, we are going to try to extract all the data from that form‚Äôs inputs and add it as <code>meta</code> to Uppy‚Äôs state. That <code>meta</code> is then merged with file‚Äôs meta when it is being added.</p>
<p>Uppy‚Äôs core options have received a new <code>meta</code> property, where you can define some metadata from the start, as well as a new <code>setMeta</code> method that can be called at any time.</p>
<p>See here for more details: <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/238" target="_blank" rel="external">#238</a> </p>
<h2 id="More"><a href="#More" class="headerlink" title="More"></a>More</h2><ul>
<li>Added a <code>reset()</code> method that stops uploads, clears files and totalProgress, and restores things to the way they were on initialization, before user interactions <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/226" target="_blank" rel="external">#226</a></li>
<li>Support for headers in Multipart plugin <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/224" target="_blank" rel="external">#224</a></li>
<li>Set bytesUploaded/bytesTotal as soon as the file is added, fixes a <code>NaN</code> issue <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/232" target="_blank" rel="external">#232</a></li>

    <title>Uppy 0.16: Transloadit!</title>
    <link href="http://uppy.io/blog/2017/05/0.16/"/>
    <id>http://uppy.io/blog/2017/05/0.16/</id>
    <published>2017-05-24T00:00:00.000Z</published>
    <updated>2017-07-20T21:31:57.708Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello there! Missed us much? :) We‚Äôre chomping at the bits, at least, to tell you about our latest release. This one has been in the works longer than usual, but then again, it‚Äôs also way cooler than usual, so let‚Äôs get right to it.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Transloadit-integration-beta"><a href="#Transloadit-integration-beta" class="headerlink" title="Transloadit integration beta"></a>Transloadit integration beta</h2><p>Yes, you read that right! We now have an easily integrable <a href="https://transloadit.com" target="_blank" rel="external">Transloadit</a> plugin. It was a big push indeed and we owe a big debt of thanks to <a href="https://github.com/goto-bus-stop" target="_blank" rel="external">Ren√©e</a> for going fully beast mode on this. The plugin is still in beta, but it works - and it‚Äôs awesome. That said, of course it is entirely optional: if you don‚Äôt use Transloadit, you don‚Äôt have to bundle the plugin.</p>
<video alt="Demo video showing the Transloadit upload plugin in action." muted autoplay loop><br>  <source src="/images/blog/0.16/transloadit.webm" type="video/webm"><br>  <source src="/images/blog/0.16/transloadit.mp4" type="video/mp4"><br></video>

<p>The Transloadit plugin for Uppy handles creating an ‚ÄúAssembly‚Äù (a file conversion job) before uploading files, and can optionally wait for file conversions to complete before showing the uploads as successful, as shown above. Listen for the <code>core:success</code> event to respond to upload completion, just like you would without the Transloadit plugin.</p>
<p>We‚Äôll be adding decent documentation to the Uppy website soon, but <a href="https://gist.github.com/kvz/8ae07aa8c063c8e55abbc1580b50c8a4#file-uppy-demo-js-L117-L147" target="_blank" rel="external">here</a> is a quick code sample of how a Transloadit plugin integration would look like already.</p>
<h2 id="More-work-on-high-level-React-components"><a href="#More-work-on-high-level-React-components" class="headerlink" title="More work on high-level React components"></a>More work on high-level React components</h2><p>Since the last release, we‚Äôve been exploring possibilities for an official set of React components. Initially, we‚Äôll be providing component wrappers for the existing Uppy UI plugins, such as the <a href="/examples/dashboard">Dashboard</a> and <a href="/examples/dragdrop">DragDrop</a> plugins. They aren‚Äôt ready yet, but if you‚Äôd like to follow along with development, check out the work that has been done so far in pull request <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/170" target="_blank" rel="external">#170</a>!</p>
<h2 id="DOM-element-in-target-option-uppy-close-for-tearing-down-an-Uppy-instance"><a href="#DOM-element-in-target-option-uppy-close-for-tearing-down-an-Uppy-instance" class="headerlink" title="DOM element in target: option, uppy.close() for tearing down an Uppy instance"></a>DOM element in <code>target:</code> option, <code>uppy.close()</code> for tearing down an Uppy instance</h2><p>While laying the groundwork for the React component integrations, Uppy has also become a bit friendlier towards being integrated with other frameworks and in single-page apps. The <code>target:</code> option in each plugin used to work only with CSS selectors, which was difficult to use if the plugin should be mounted on a dynamically generated element. In 0.16, either a query selector or an actual DOM element can be passed in.</p>
<p>The new <code>.close()</code> method on the Uppy instance cleans up all of Uppy‚Äôs event handlers and DOM elements. Useful when navigating away from a page with an Uppy uploader in a single-page app, or when unmounting a React component that contains an Uppy instance!</p>
<h2 id="Server-time"><a href="#Server-time" class="headerlink" title="Server time!"></a>Server time!</h2><p>We got everything covered - front-to-back-end - so you can be sure we also got some things going on the server side.</p>
<ul>
<li>parallelizing downloading/uploading remote files: start uploading chunks right away, while still downloading the file on disk. Even though the server may download files relatively faster, it is good to know that you don‚Äôt have to wait out the download before the upload begins. </li>
<li>Image thumbnails are now also shown for remote files.</li>
<li>Automated tests have been added using the test library, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/" target="_blank" rel="external">jest</a>.</li>
<li>Remote files are now deleted from local disk immediately after a successful upload.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="And"><a href="#And" class="headerlink" title="And"></a>And</h2><p>Multiple necessary chores (the kind you don‚Äôt like to talk about at parties), such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>Replacing <code>babel-preset-es2015-loose</code> by the standard es2015 preset with <code>loose</code> option</li>
<li>Merging the Tus10 plugin options with <code>tus-js-client</code> options</li>
<li>We reviewed the uppy-server README to be more elaborate when getting started.</li>
<li>The Service logo is now visible on the corresponding file in the Dashboard. For example if a file is being uploaded from Google Drive you would see a Google Drive logo easily identifying where the file is from. Take a look!</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/blog/0.16/service-logos.png"></p>
<h2 id="Release-Notes"><a href="#Release-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Release Notes"></a>Release Notes</h2><p>Here is the full list of changes for version 0.16:</p>

    <title>Uppy 0.15: Spring cleanup</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Spring is in the air and Uppy is feeling particularly full of life. In this post about Uppy 0.15, we have some exciting stories about <code>babel-plugin-yo-yoify</code>, progress event throttling, and new friends.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Yo-yoify-for-NPM-installed-Uppy"><a href="#Yo-yoify-for-NPM-installed-Uppy" class="headerlink" title="Yo-yoify for NPM-installed Uppy"></a>Yo-yoify for NPM-installed Uppy</h2><p>In <a href="http://localhost:4000/blog/2017/02/0.14/" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>0.14</code></a>, we added <code>yo-yoify</code> transform to give Uppy some extra speed and eliminate <code>Function.caller</code> issues. As it turned out, we <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/158" target="_blank" rel="external">forgot</a> about our Babel-transpiled <code>lib</code> version of Uppy that gets published to NPM üôÄ. We then spent some time creating a standalone version of <code>yo-yoify</code> that would be able to parse <code>yo-yo</code> template strings before Babel-transpilation, only to discover that there already is a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-yo-yoify" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>babel-plugin-yo-yoify</code></a> that not only does precisely that, but also frees us from jumping through a lot of unnecessary hoops. It did <a href="https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/issues/9" target="_blank" rel="external">have</a> <a href="https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/pull/8" target="_blank" rel="external">a few</a> <a href="https://github.com/goto-bus-stop/babel-plugin-yo-yoify/issues/11" target="_blank" rel="external">issues</a> at first, but luckily our friend <a href="https://github.com/goto-bus-stop" target="_blank" rel="external">Ren√©e</a> was available to colaborate with us on this. Ren√©e has also agreed to join Uppy for a while to help us with other pressing issues. So, silver linings ‚Äî bugs can sometimes lead to new friends and wonderful beginnings. We are very excited about what this all means for Uppy in the months to come.</p>
<p>Uppy from NPM is now good to go and the issue has been completely resolved. You can update at: <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/uppy" target="_blank" rel="external">https://www.npmjs.com/package/uppy</a>. And yeah, if you use <code>yo-yo</code>, give <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/babel-plugin-yo-yoify" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>babel-plugin-yo-yoify</code></a> a try.</p>
<h2 id="Pause-amp-Resume-Remote-Uploads"><a href="#Pause-amp-Resume-Remote-Uploads" class="headerlink" title="Pause &amp; Resume Remote Uploads"></a>Pause &amp; Resume Remote Uploads</h2><p>Just like with ‚Äúlocal‚Äù uploads, Uppy can now pause and resume remote uploads from Google Drive or Dropbox (handled on the backend by <code>uppy-server</code> + <code>tus</code>). üéâ</p>
<h2 id="Progress-Throttling"><a href="#Progress-Throttling" class="headerlink" title="Progress Throttling"></a>Progress Throttling</h2><p>While working on pausing remote uploads with <code>uppy-server</code>, Ife discovered a strange bug: uppy-client would hang during the upload, after which the progress would immediately jump to 100%. After some solid Sherlock Holmesing, we found what was causing it: uploads were happening too fast. This was leading to progress events being sent very, very often (like 300 / second), which trashed the interface rendering loop. We have solved this by <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-js-client/commit/9940f27b2361fd7e10ba58b09b60d82422183bbb" target="_blank" rel="external">adding throttling in tus-js-client</a> (thanks Marius!) and <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server/commit/936ad48e92631c45d123664900b9aabcf7a190fa" target="_blank" rel="external">uppy-server</a> (thanks Ife!). I would also very much like to take this opportunity to thank myself for <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/1d5f4404546420442deabc94df84bd3ec0677eec" target="_blank" rel="external">fixing</a> <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/commit/db32c6f4fd85420532f27f04920dbaf6d126ea9b" target="_blank" rel="external">it</a> in uppy-client too! :innocent:</p>
<p>To prevent ‚Äújumping‚Äù progress, numbers and text in StatusBar are now only updated once a second. Plus, we have switched to <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/prettier-bytes" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>prettier-bytes</code></a>, which adds some nice number rounding. Smooth as butter!</p>
<p>TL;DR Uppy was simply too fast at uploading, so we had to shorten the leash a bit!</p>
<h2 id="Informer-coming-at-you-in-full-color-mode"><a href="#Informer-coming-at-you-in-full-color-mode" class="headerlink" title="Informer coming at you in full-color mode"></a>Informer coming at you in full-color mode</h2><p>Informer will now be able to change the way it looks depending on the <code>type</code> argument:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="comment">// (`'informer'`, `text`, `type`, `duration`)</span></div><div class="line">uppy.emit(<span class="string">'informer'</span>, <span class="string">'Connected!'</span>, <span class="string">'success'</span>, <span class="number">3000</span>)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/images/blog/0.15/informer.png"></p>
<p>This supports the following <code>type</code>s: <code>info</code>, <code>warning</code>, <code>error</code>, <code>success</code>, all with their own colors!</p>
<h2 id="Some-other-things"><a href="#Some-other-things" class="headerlink" title="Some other things"></a>Some other things</h2><ul>
<li>Multipart now treats all 2xx responses as successful and returns xhr object in <code>core:upload-success</code> event callback.</li>
<li>That progress circle that you can see on each file in Dashboard has been improved on the inside: precise <code>circleLength</code> and <code>stroke-dasharray/stroke-dashoffset</code> calculation.</li>
<li>Uppy-server returns uploaded file urls and sizes for remote uploads (from Google Drive &amp; Dropbox).</li>
<li>Provider plugins now have a loading screen, error screen and logout link. Breadcrumbs are also working again.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Release-Notes"><a href="#Release-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Release Notes"></a>Release Notes</h2><p>Here is the full list of changes for version 0.15:</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi! Hope y‚Äôall have had great holidays! üéÑ Which reminds us, we still have a gift for you ‚Äî and we even wrapped it in a package (npm). Look inside and you‚Äôll find that Uppy 0.14!</p>
<p>‚ÄúBut wait‚Äù, you might ask, ‚Äúwhere is the 0.13 release that we have been waiting for?‚Äù</p>
<p>Well, let‚Äôs just say we are superstitious like that. You won‚Äôt see us coding under any ladders either! And we were also in the middle of the holiday season, so we decided to call 0.13 ‚ÄúThe Release That Wasn‚Äôt‚Äù and skip it.</p>
<p>Let‚Äôs take a look at what Uppy 0.14 has in store for you.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Major-Uppy-Server-Updates"><a href="#Major-Uppy-Server-Updates" class="headerlink" title="Major Uppy Server Updates"></a>Major Uppy Server Updates</h2><p><strong>Express.js</strong><br>We‚Äôve switched to Express from Koa. It‚Äôs more widely adopted and supported, has larger community and better maintained packages, so we went for it.</p>
<p><strong>Pluggable or standalone</strong><br>Uppy Server can now be plugged into your existing Express/Koa server app, but you can also still run it as a standalone server. <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy-server#run-as-standalone-server" target="_blank" rel="external">See here</a> for further instructions.</p>
<p><strong>Smooth authentication</strong><br>It used to be the case that when you clicked that stylish ‚Äúauthenticate‚Äù [with Google Drive] button, you were taken away from the page, and things tended to get lost. That has now all been made silky smooth: upon clicking the button, a fresh tab will open in your browser, which will take you to the authentication page ‚Äì be it on Google Drive, Dropbox, or somewhere else. When you are done, this tab is automagically closed, and you are back where you were, authenticated, with all your remote files at hand.</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/blog/0.14/smooth-auth.png"></p>
<p><strong>Dropbox plugin</strong><br>Dropbox support made it into Uppy this release! üéâ <a href="https://github.com/ifedapoolarewaju" target="_blank" rel="external">Ife</a> rocks like that. (A shoutout here as well to <a href="https://github.com/hedgerh" target="_blank" rel="external">Harry</a> for the initial work on Uppy Server and the Google Drive plugin!) Why don‚Äôt you <a href="https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/">give it a try</a>!</p>
<p><img class="border" src="/images/blog/0.14/uppy-dropbox.png"></p>
<p>What‚Äôs more, the client-side code of Google Drive and Dropbox plugins is slowly being refactored into a generic provider view that can be shared among all services.</p>
<h2 id="Dashboard"><a href="#Dashboard" class="headerlink" title="Dashboard"></a>Dashboard</h2><p><strong>Responsive UI and more icons</strong><br>The Dashboard now adapts itself to screen sizes big and small. That includes <code>inline</code> mode, where you can set <code>maxWidth</code> and <code>maxHeight</code> in options, like so:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">uppy.use(Dashboard, &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">maxWidth</span>: <span class="number">300</span>,</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">maxHeight</span>: <span class="number">350</span>,</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">inline</span>: <span class="literal">true</span>,</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">target</span>: <span class="string">'#myUploadContainer'</span></div><div class="line">&#125;)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>We are not using media queries here, but have instead added a <code>UppyDashboard--wide</code> CSS class, which allows for more flexibility ‚Äî your file uploading widget can be tiny even if the screen is large.</p>
<p>When there is little space available, the file grid view that you have become used to, will turn into a new compact list view.</p>
<figure class="wide"><img src="/images/blog/0.14/dashboard-grid-list.jpg"></figure>

<p>We are also adding more file type icons and trying to be smarter about detecting them. We have new icons for video, audio, text, and PDF for you to enjoy.</p>
<p><strong>Total / uploaded sizes</strong><br>Total and uploaded sizes have been added to the StatusBar, allowing you and your users to keep track of all those bits and bytes.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/0.14/statusbar-uploaded-total-size.png"></p>
<p>You can play with all of these new features on <a href="https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/">the Dashboard example page</a>.</p>
<!-- more -->
<h2 id="Per-plugin-locale-settings"><a href="#Per-plugin-locale-settings" class="headerlink" title="Per plugin locale settings"></a>Per plugin locale settings</h2><p>We have moved locale settings from global/core to plugins. By default, each UI plugin ships with an English locale, and you can override any string with your own, like so:</p>
<figure class="highlight js"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">uppy.use(DragDrop, &#123;<span class="attr">target</span>: <span class="string">'.drop'</span>, <span class="attr">locale</span>: &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="attr">strings</span>: &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="attr">chooseFile</span>: <span class="string">'Valitse tiedoston'</span>,</div><div class="line">    <span class="attr">orDragDrop</span>: <span class="string">'tai siirt√§√§ t√§nne'</span>,</div><div class="line">  &#125;</div><div class="line">&#125;&#125;)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p><img src="/images/blog/0.14/dnd-fi.png"></p>
<p>And just like that, your Drag&amp;Drop plugin now speaks Finnish! <em>Hyv√§√§ huomenta!</em> This feature is a work in progress, we are trying to find the sweet spot between <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/8c6252933813af69c1b71ec4621a7fc14dfb3ab0/src/locales/pt_BR.js" target="_blank" rel="external">bundling a whole bunch of strings in packs</a>, which might be redundant (i.e. if you only use the Drag&amp;Drop, you don‚Äôt need strings from the Dashboard), and making you choose or set language strings for each UI plugin. We‚Äôd love to <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/42" target="_blank" rel="external">hear what you think</a>.</p>
<h2 id="Misc"><a href="#Misc" class="headerlink" title="Misc"></a>Misc</h2><ul>
<li><a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yoify" target="_blank" rel="external">yo-yoify</a> has been added to our build setup in order to solve a <a href="https://github.com/shama/bel#note" target="_blank" rel="external">Function.caller / strict mode issue</a> and to make the app faster/smaller by transforming template strings into pure and fast document calls.</li>
<li>By the way, Uppy‚Äôs UI DOM is powered by <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/yo-yo" target="_blank" rel="external">yo-yo</a>. We like yo-yo for its simplicity, speed and small size, but sometimes there are issues, one of them being the lack of wide adoption. We are looking at <a href="https://preactjs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Preact</a>, but are also quite excited about <a href="https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/nanocomponent" target="_blank" rel="external">Nanocomponent</a>.</li>
<li>Progress events that were not being properly sent from Uppy Server as now fixed. As it turns out, this occurred because server uploads were happening too fast, before the client was actually able to connect to the server. :scream: Guess that‚Äôs a good problem to have solved!</li>
<li>We have recently added Uppy to <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy" target="_blank" rel="external">Product Hunt</a> and we were very pleased with the warm welcome, we even made it to the front page a few days later. Let‚Äôs hope it will help get more people excited about the project.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Release-Notes"><a href="#Release-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Release Notes"></a>Release Notes</h2><p>Here is the full list of changes for version 0.14:</p>

<li>dashboard: use <code>isWide</code> prop/class instead of media queries, so that compact/mobile version can be used in bigger screens too (@arturi)</li>

    <title>Uppy 0.12: Responsive. Cancel. Feedback. Refreshed¬†ES6 server</title>
    <link href="http://uppy.io/blog/2016/12/0.12/"/>
    <id>http://uppy.io/blog/2016/12/0.12/</id>
    <published>2016-12-07T00:00:00.000Z</published>
    <updated>2017-07-20T21:31:57.708Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hello! Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new in Uppy 0.12.</p>
<h2 id="Dashboard-local-mode-and-multipart-uploads-support-in-UI"><a href="#Dashboard-local-mode-and-multipart-uploads-support-in-UI" class="headerlink" title="Dashboard: local mode and multipart uploads support in UI"></a>Dashboard: local mode and multipart uploads support in UI</h2><p>Prior to this release, we‚Äôve optimized the Dashboard for usage with multiple ‚Äúacquire plugins‚Äù, say Webcam + Google Drive. But sometimes all you need is ‚Äúlocal disk‚Äù with drag &amp; drop support, nice file previews and progress. And now the Dashboard UI works great with that use case out of the box. When you don‚Äôt add (.use) any acquire plugins, it looks like this:</p>
<figure class="wide"><img src="/images/blog/0.12/uppy-dashboard-local.jpg"></figure>

<p>Also (prior to this release), we‚Äôve built the Dashboard to work well with <a href="http://tus.io" target="_blank" rel="external">tus resumable uploads</a>. That‚Äôs why you can pause and resume individual uploads, as well as all at once. But if you use an endpoint that is not yet ready for the future and upload resumability (here‚Äôs <a href="https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server" target="_blank" rel="external">how</a> to <a href="https://github.com/tus/tusd" target="_blank" rel="external">fix that</a>, by the way), the Dashboard UI will show regular ‚Äúcancel‚Äù buttons instead of pause/resume.</p>
<p>Dashboard is gradually becoming more mobile friendly too, but we‚Äôll be saving some of that stuff for the next release.</p>
<h2 id="Server"><a href="#Server" class="headerlink" title="Server"></a>Server</h2><p>Uppy server has undergone a quite a few changes, including the build setup:</p>
<ul>
<li>We are using ES2015, transpiling to ES5 with Babel.</li>
<li>Added linting, lint-staged, pre-commit all that good stuff.</li>
<li>Added <code>npm run release</code> command that publishes releases for us.</li>
<li>Google Drive is working again on the Uppy Server side.</li>
<li>Refactoring, error handling and more minor improvements.</li>
</ul>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="And"><a href="#And" class="headerlink" title="And"></a>And</h2><ul>
<li>The website now features a video demo of Uppy in action, check it out: <a href="http://uppy.io">http://uppy.io</a>.</li>
<li>Fixed a bug where the Webcam would continue to be active (green light on) even after the picture was taken ‚Äî all good now.</li>
<li>Improved import/require support for ES2015 and CommonJS modules. Basically, we don‚Äôt recommend ES2015 spread imports as a default option just yet ‚Äî no tree shaking in Browserify and Webpack 1. Both <code>import DragDrop from &#39;uppy/lib/plugin/DragDrop&#39;</code> and <code>const DragDrop = require(&#39;uppy/lib/plugin/DragDrop&#39;)</code> are now supported. We‚Äôve added <code>add-module-exports</code> babel plugin that replaces <code>export default</code> with <code>module.exports</code> for backwards compatibility.</li>
<li>Optimized dependencies a little: removed the ones we don‚Äôt use, upgraded some that we do.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Release-Notes"><a href="#Release-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Release Notes"></a>Release Notes</h2><p>Here is the full list of changes for version 0.12:</p>
<ul>
<li>meta: write 0.12 release blog post (@arturi)</li>
<li>core: figure out import/require for core and plugins ‚Äî just don‚Äôt use spread for plugins (@arturi)</li>
<li>meta: create a demo GIF, showcasing Uppy Dashboard for the main page, like <a href="https://zeit.co/blog/next" target="_blank" rel="external">https://zeit.co/blog/next</a> (@arturi)</li>
<li>meta: update Readme, update screenshot (@arturi)</li>
<li>server: add pre-commit and lint-staged (@arturi)</li>
<li>server: re-do build setup: building at <code>deploy</code> and <code>prepublish</code> when typing <code>npm run release:patch</code> 0.0.1 -&gt; 0.0.2 (@ifedapoolarewaju)</li>
<li>server: re-do build setup: es6 <code>src</code> -&gt; es5 <code>lib</code> (use plugin packs from Uppy)</li>
<li>server: re-do build setup: <code>eslint --fix ./src</code> via <a href="http://standardjs.com" target="_blank" rel="external">http://standardjs.com</a> (@ifedapoolarewaju)</li>
<li>server: re-do build setup: <code>babel-node</code> or <code>babel-require</code> could do realtime transpiling for development (how does that hook in with e.g. <code>nodemon</code>?) (@ifedapoolarewaju)</li>
<li>server: refacor: remove/reduce file redundancy (@ifedapoolarewaju)</li>
<li>server: error handling: 404 and 401 error handler (@ifedapoolarewaju)</li>

      &lt;p&gt;Hello! Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new in Uppy 0.12.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Dashboard-local-mode-and-multipart-uploads-support-in-UI&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Dashboard-local-mode-and-multipart-uploads-support-in-UI&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Dashboard: local mode and multipart uploads support in UI&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Dashboard: local mode and multipart uploads support in UI&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Prior to this release, we‚Äôve optimized the Dashboard for usage with multiple ‚Äúacquire plugins‚Äù, say Webcam + Google Drive. But sometimes all you need is ‚Äúlocal disk‚Äù with drag &amp;amp; drop support, nice file previews and progress. And now the Dashboard UI works great with that use case out of the box. When you don‚Äôt add (.use) any acquire plugins, it looks like this:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;figure class=&quot;wide&quot;&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/images/blog/0.12/uppy-dashboard-local.jpg&quot;&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also (prior to this release), we‚Äôve built the Dashboard to work well with &lt;a href=&quot;http://tus.io&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;tus resumable uploads&lt;/a&gt;. That‚Äôs why you can pause and resume individual uploads, as well as all at once. But if you use an endpoint that is not yet ready for the future and upload resumability (here‚Äôs &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tus/tus-node-server&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;how&lt;/a&gt; to &lt;a href=&quot;https://github.com/tus/tusd&quot; target=&quot;_blank&quot; rel=&quot;external&quot;&gt;fix that&lt;/a&gt;, by the way), the Dashboard UI will show regular ‚Äúcancel‚Äù buttons instead of pause/resume.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Dashboard is gradually becoming more mobile friendly too, but we‚Äôll be saving some of that stuff for the next release.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id=&quot;Server&quot;&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;#Server&quot; class=&quot;headerlink&quot; title=&quot;Server&quot;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;Server&lt;/h2&gt;&lt;p&gt;Uppy server has undergone a quite a few changes, including the build setup:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;We are using ES2015, transpiling to ES5 with Babel.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added linting, lint-staged, pre-commit all that good stuff.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Added &lt;code&gt;npm run release&lt;/code&gt; command that publishes releases for us.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Google Drive is working again on the Uppy Server side.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Refactoring, error handling and more minor improvements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

    <updated>2017-07-20T21:31:57.708Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hey everyone! It has been a while since we last shared some news about our progress and we can‚Äôt wait to let you know what‚Äôs up(py)!</p>
<p>In October, we have been working hard to get Uppy 0.11 ready for release. This entailed, among other things, doing a write-up of our general architecture, bringing in a friend to look at what we‚Äôve been up to, experimenting with Redux, and updating the Dashboard UI and website example.</p>
<p>Here‚Äôs what we have been up to, in some more detail.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="More-research-and-experiments"><a href="#More-research-and-experiments" class="headerlink" title="More research and experiments"></a>More research and experiments</h2><ul>
<li>We wrote an <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/blob/master/ARCHITECTURE.md" target="_blank" rel="external">ARCHITECTURE.md</a> document, describing our architecture and APIs.</li>
<li>Author of <a href="https://github.com/yoshuawuyts/choo" target="_blank" rel="external">Choo</a>, Yoshua Wuyts, was invited to take a look at the state of things in Uppy, and he came up with a proposal for some changes, which we‚Äôll be considering in the coming releases.</li>
<li>We also conducted a few Redux experiments on Uppy, in the process of which, no animals were hurt. :dog:</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Dashboard-example-features-StatusBar-and-updated-UI"><a href="#Dashboard-example-features-StatusBar-and-updated-UI" class="headerlink" title="Dashboard: example features, StatusBar and updated UI"></a>Dashboard: example features, StatusBar and updated UI</h2><p><strong>Dashboard example</strong> <a href="https://uppy.io/examples/dashboard/">on our website</a> now features several options:</p>
<ul>
<li>switchting between ‚Äúinline‚Äù and ‚Äúmodal dialog / popup‚Äù mode;</li>
<li>toggling the <code>autoProceed</code> option that starts uploads automatically, without waiting for a click on the ‚Äúupload‚Äù button;</li>
<li>enabling/disabling acquire plugins, like Google Drive and Webcam.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="/images/blog/0.11/dashboard-example-options.png"></p>
<p><strong>StatusBar</strong> is a ‚Äì you guessed it ‚Äì bar that appears on the bottom of the Dashboard and unifies progress with pause/resume buttons.</p>
<p><strong>Dashboard UI</strong> has undergone minor improvements, such as: a new ‚Äúdrag files here‚Äù icon and tagline. Furthermore, the text before ‚Äúacquire‚Äù icons on the top ‚Äî Local Disk, Google Drive, Webcam ‚Äî has been removed (it used to say ‚ÄúImport files from:‚Äù). We also added new ‚Äúremove file‚Äù icons. You know, small things, big difference. :sunglasses:</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/0.11/uppy-dashboard-oct-2016-1.jpg" alt="Dashboard UI, no files. Text: Drop files here, paste or import from one of the locations above"></p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/0.11/uppy-dashboard-oct-2016-2.jpg" alt="Dashboard UI, file upload in progress. StatusBar with pause/resume button and progress"></p>
<h2 id="HTTPS"><a href="#HTTPS" class="headerlink" title="HTTPS"></a>HTTPS</h2><p>We have upgraded both <a href="http://uppy.io/">uppy.io</a> and <a href="http://tus.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">tus.io</a> to support HTTPS with Let‚Äôs Encrypt. This will ensure that webcam example now works, secure uploads work, and ‚Äì hopefully ‚Äì that all will be well.</p>
<h2 id="And-more"><a href="#And-more" class="headerlink" title="And more"></a>And more</h2><ul>
<li>We have renamed FormTag plugin to FileInput and made it pretty by default, with an added option to just show the default browser ‚Äúchoose file‚Äù.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/126" target="_blank" rel="external">Fixed a bug</a> with <code>autoProceed: true</code> duplicating uploads.</li>
<li>Refactored Dashboard to only keep active acquire panel in DOM.</li>
<li>Added PersistentState plugin that saves state to localStorage ‚Äî which is useful for development.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/pull/131" target="_blank" rel="external">Grand refactor of Uppy Server</a> with dynamic controllers.</li>
<li>Webcam stream no longer flashes when state is updated.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Release-Notes"><a href="#Release-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Release Notes"></a>Release Notes</h2><p>Here is the full list of changes for version 0.11:</p>
<ul>
<li>core: log method should have an option to throw error in addition to just logging (@arturi)</li>
<li>experimental: PersistentState plugin that saves state to localStorage ‚Äî useful for development (@arturi)</li>
<li>dashboard: implement new StatusBar with progress and pause/resume buttons <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/96#issuecomment-249401532" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/96#issuecomment-249401532</a> (@arturi)</li>
<li>dashboard: attempt to throttle StatusBar, so it doesn‚Äôt re-render too often (@arturi)</li>
<li>dashboard: refactor ‚Äî only load one acquire panel at a time (activeAcquirer or empty), change focus behavior, utilize onload/onunload</li>
<li>experimental: create a Dashboard UI for Redux refactor (@hedgerh)</li>
<li>dashboard: make trigger optional ‚Äî not needed when rendering inline (@arturi)</li>
<li>fileinput: pretty input element #93 (@arturi)</li>
<li>meta: document current Uppy architecture and question about the future (@arturi, @hedgerh)</li>
<li>test: see about adding tests for autoProceed: true (@arturi)</li>
<li>website: and ability to toggle options in Dashboard example: inline/modal, autoProceed, which plugins are enabled #89 (@arturi)</li>
<li>website: finish https upgrade for uppy.io, uppy-server and tus, set up pingdom notifications (@arturi, @kvz, @hedgerh)</li>
<li>website: update guide, API docs and main page example to match current actual API (@arturi)</li>
<li>uppy-server: Make uppy server have dynamic controllers (@hedgerh)</li>
</ul>
<p>We hope you‚Äôll enjoy this latest release. We have got a lot more in store for Uppy and we won‚Äôt wait too long with throwing you a bone again!</p>

    <title>Uppy 0.10: Getting together, the future, Google Drive UI, exposed events</title>

    <updated>2017-07-20T21:31:57.708Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>Hi! Another month has passed and we have just released a new version of Uppy. Here‚Äôs what we‚Äôve been up to.</p>
<h2 id="Thinking-about-the-future-üîÆ"><a href="#Thinking-about-the-future-üîÆ" class="headerlink" title="Thinking about the future üîÆ"></a>Thinking about the future üîÆ</h2><p>We have been spending quite a lot of time thinking about Uppy‚Äôs future and the direction in which we would like to take this project.  Our primary concern is making Uppy as flexible as possible as well as compatible with popular libraries, such as React and React Native.  We also want to make it easy to port Uppy to any environments or ecosystems that are not officially supported.</p>
<p>We have done a lot of research. We created <a href="https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-react" target="_blank" rel="external">prototypes of Uppy React components</a> and  we also created a new module that we like to call ‚ÄúUppy Base.‚Äù <a href="https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-base" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>uppy-base</code></a> is a thin module containing reusable functionality from some of our plugins that can be used in any ecosystem or environment, without being opinionated about the UI.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>Finally, we are also discussing using <a href="https://github.com/reactjs/redux" target="_blank" rel="external">Redux</a> as the internal state management store within Uppy.  You can see some drafts under the <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/src/experimental" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>src/experimental</code> folder</a>.</p>
<p>Have a look at the <a href="https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-base" target="_blank" rel="external">Uppy Base repository here</a>.</p>
<p>Check out <a href="https://github.com/hedgerh/uppy-react" target="_blank" rel="external">our Uppy React wrapper and components</a>, which are built on top of Uppy Base.</p>
<p>Finally, we have played a bit with <a href="https://github.com/css-modules" target="_blank" rel="external">CSS Modules</a> and <a href="https://github.com/rtsao/csjs" target="_blank" rel="external">CSJS</a>.  We have also tried generating preview thumbnails in Web Workers, as well as with <a href="https://github.com/nodeca/pica" target="_blank" rel="external">Pica library</a>.</p>
<p>We would love to hear feedback on all of this.  Please join our discussion at: <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/116" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/116</a></p>
<p>You are, of course, more than welcome to chime in on other issues or to open new ones!</p>
<h2 id="Dashboard-refreshed-look-and-new-features"><a href="#Dashboard-refreshed-look-and-new-features" class="headerlink" title="Dashboard: refreshed look and new features"></a>Dashboard: refreshed look and new features</h2><p>In an attempt to be brave and keep things simple, we have removed the dashed border from inside the Dashboard, rewritten its layout with flexbox, and tried out a new <a href="https://cloud.githubusercontent.com/assets/1199054/18763191/35d31ddc-80da-11e6-9a2c-c46388857135.png" target="_blank" rel="external">blend-in-with-the-background-and-blur</a> mode.</p>
<p><img alt="Refreshed Dashboard UI" src="/images/blog/0.10/dashboard-sep-27-2016.jpg"></p>
<p>Uppy now also has the option to render the Dashboard inline on the page, instead of the default full modal dialog. To try it out, set <code>inline: true</code> in options, like this: <code>uppy.use(Dashboard, {target: &#39;.myContainer&#39;, inline: true})</code>.</p>
<p>We have also added a circular progress bar that shows total upload progress, combined with a pause all / resume all button, and an info panel that shows speed, ETA and status for all uploads currently in progress. So you‚Äôll have something fun and useful to look at while you are waiting!</p>
<p><img alt="Dashboard UI with global pause/resume buttons and a status bar ‚Äî progress speed & ETA" src="/images/blog/0.10/dashboard-pause-resume-sep-27-2016.jpg"></p>
<p>Be sure not to miss out on the new Copy Link button that appears after a successful upload, right where the edit button usually is. We know, that‚Äôs pretty exciting! And it gets even better: when you click on it, the link is copied to your clipboard. Or, in less capable browsers, a window pops up with a text link, so you can copy it yourself. Bananas!</p>
<h2 id="Google-Drive-UI-improved"><a href="#Google-Drive-UI-improved" class="headerlink" title="Google Drive UI improved"></a>Google Drive UI improved</h2><p>The UI for Google Drive has received a fresh new redesign.  Check it out!</p>
<p><img alt="The redesigned file browser UI for Google Drive" src="/images/blog/0.10/google-drive-ui-sep-27-2016.jpg"></p>
<h2 id="Listen-to-events"><a href="#Listen-to-events" class="headerlink" title="Listen to events"></a>Listen to events</h2><p>We have finally begun to expose events on the <code>uppy</code> instance, so you can now subscribe to them and use them in your app. For example, in order to display an image in your UI after it has been successfully uploaded:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">uppy.on(<span class="string">'core:upload-success'</span>, (id, url) =&gt; &#123;</div><div class="line">  <span class="keyword">var</span> img = <span class="keyword">new</span> Image()</div><div class="line">  img.width = <span class="number">300</span></div><div class="line">  img.alt = id</div><div class="line">  img.src = url</div><div class="line">  <span class="built_in">document</span>.body.appendChild(img)</div><div class="line">&#125;)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>There is also <code>core:upload-progress</code> to track progress and <code>core:success</code> for when all uploads are complete. The <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/#api" target="_blank" rel="external">event documentation</a> is quite small right now, we‚Äôll be adding more once we sort out the API.</p>
<h2 id="But-wait-there‚Äôs-more"><a href="#But-wait-there‚Äôs-more" class="headerlink" title="But wait, there‚Äôs more!"></a>But wait, there‚Äôs more!</h2><ul>
<li>i18n strings now extend default en_US dictionary: if a certain string is not available in a language, the English string will be displayed.</li>
<li>Updated readme: improved usage docs and CDN links. Check out <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/#usage" target="_blank" rel="external">the new usage section</a> for yourself. Import, require or script tag? In any case, we‚Äôve got your back.</li>
<li>Capabilities: we have added <code>capabilities</code> to the state.  For example, if ‚Äòtus‚Äô resumable uploader is used, <code>capabilities.resumable === true</code> is added to the state, so it is easy to check what upload capabilities are available. More to come.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="Release-Notes"><a href="#Release-Notes" class="headerlink" title="Release Notes"></a>Release Notes</h2><p>Here is the full list of changes for version 0.10.0:</p>
<ul>
<li>core: expose some events/APIs/callbacks to the user: <code>onFileUploaded</code>, <code>onFileSelected</code>, <code>onAllUploaded</code>, <code>addFile</code> (or <code>parseFile</code>), open modal‚Ä¶ (@arturi, @hedgerh)</li>
<li>core: how would Uppy work without the UI, if one wants to Uppy to just add files and upload, while rendering preview and UI by themselves #116 ‚Äî discussion Part 1 (@arturi, @hedgerh)</li>
<li>core: refactor towards react compatibility as discussed in <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/110" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/issues/110</a> (@hedgerh)</li>
<li>core: CSS modules? allow bundling of CSS in JS for simple use in NPM? See #120#issuecomment-242455042, try <a href="https://github.com/rtsao/csjs" target="_blank" rel="external">https://github.com/rtsao/csjs</a> ‚Äî verdict: not yet, try again later (@arturi, @hedgerh)</li>
<li>core: try Web Workers and FileReaderSync for image resizing again ‚Äî still slow, probably message payload between webworker and regular thread is huge (@arturi)</li>
<li>core: i18n strings should extend default en_US dictionary ‚Äî if a certain string in not available in German, English should be displayed (@arturi)</li>
<li>dashboard: refactor to smaller components, pass props down (@arturi)</li>
<li>dashboard: option to render Dashboard inline instead of a modal dialog (@arturi)</li>
<li>dashboard: global circular progress bar, try out different designs for total upload speed and ETA (@arturi)</li>
<li>dashboard: show total upload speed and ETA, for all files (@arturi)</li>
<li>dashboard: copy link to uploaded file button, cross-browser (@arturi) (<a href="http://i.imgur.com/b1Io34n.png" target="_blank" rel="external">http://i.imgur.com/b1Io34n.png</a>) (@arturi)</li>
<li>dashobard: refreshed design and grand refactor (@arturi)</li>
<li>dashboard: improve file paste the best we can <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/a/22940020" target="_blank" rel="external">http://stackoverflow.com/a/22940020</a> (@arturi)</li>
<li>provider: abstract google drive into provider plugin for reuse (@hedgerh)</li>
<li>google drive: improve UI (@hedgerh)</li>
<li>tus: add <code>resumable</code> capability flag (@arturi)</li>
<li>tus: start fixing pause/resume issues and race conditions (@arturi)</li>
<li>test: working Uppy example on Require Bin ‚Äî latest version straight from NPM <a href="http://requirebin.com/?gist=54e076cccc929cc567cb0aba38815105" target="_blank" rel="external">http://requirebin.com/?gist=54e076cccc929cc567cb0aba38815105</a> (@arturi @account)</li>

    <title>Uppy 0.9: Making Progress, then pause &amp; resume. Remote file uploads, Informer.</title>

    <updated>2017-07-20T21:31:57.708Z</updated>
    
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have just released Uppy 0.9.0. This release features some changes that we think you will be very excited about.  Let‚Äôs see what‚Äôs new!</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Ability-to-pause-uploads-progress-indicators-amp-ETA"><a href="#Ability-to-pause-uploads-progress-indicators-amp-ETA" class="headerlink" title="Ability to pause uploads, progress indicators &amp; ETA"></a>Ability to pause uploads, progress indicators &amp; ETA</h2><p>The most visible feature that has been added is the ability to pause and resume file uploads.</p>
<p><img alt="dashboard UI with paused uploads" src="/images/blog/0.9/upload-pause.jpg" class="border"></p>
<p><img alt="dashboard UI with files uploading and a pause all button" src="/images/blog/0.9/upload-resume.jpg" class="border"></p>
<p>The upload dashboard now contains more information about uploads, such as the time remaining until an upload is finished. We have also added circular progress indicators to give better visual feedback on an upload‚Äôs progress.</p>
<h2 id="Remote-file-uploads"><a href="#Remote-file-uploads" class="headerlink" title="Remote file uploads"></a>Remote file uploads</h2><p>Remote file uploading is now working again.</p>
<h2 id="Informer-interface"><a href="#Informer-interface" class="headerlink" title="Informer interface"></a>Informer interface</h2><p>We have added a new <code>Informer</code> plugin (tested with <code>Dashboard</code>, should also work anywhere else) that listens to <code>informer</code> events, like so:<br><figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line">bus.emit(<span class="string">'informer'</span>, message, type, duration)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure></p>
<p> and displays a message bubble for a certain amount of time. It will be useful to notify you when the internet connection is (a licky boom-boom) down (or back up):</p>
<p><img alt="info: no connection" src="/images/blog/0.9/info-no-connection.jpg" class="border"></p>
<p>Or when Uppy has successfully uploaded your files:</p>
<p><img alt="info: upload successful" src="/images/blog/0.9/info-upload-success.jpg" class="border"></p>
<h2 id="Webcam-Say-Cheese"><a href="#Webcam-Say-Cheese" class="headerlink" title="Webcam: Say Cheese!"></a>Webcam: Say Cheese!</h2><p>The Webcam plugin can now take snapshots and add them to the file dashboard in Uppy‚Äôs modal.  We have also added Flash support for Safari/IE users.  The UI has also been cleaned up in the dashboard.  We have temporarily disabled video recording in order to focus on rolling out the snapshot feature.</p>
<h2 id="Under-the-hood-UI-refactors"><a href="#Under-the-hood-UI-refactors" class="headerlink" title="Under the hood: UI refactors"></a>Under the hood: UI refactors</h2><p>Under the hood, we have made some changes to how the UI is structured.  We are taking a more componentized approach.  For example, the rendering of Google Drive‚Äôs UI has been separated into multiple smaller components that can be found in the <a href="https://github.com/transloadit/uppy/tree/master/src/plugins/GoogleDrive" target="_blank" rel="external"><code>plugins/GoogleDrive</code> folder</a>.</p>

    <title>Uppy version 0.8 released: The Webcam Edition and Meta Data</title>
    <link href="http://uppy.io/blog/2016/08/0.8.0/"/>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>We have just released Uppy 0.8.0 and we can‚Äôt wait to tell you more about it. Along with various under-the-hood improvements, this release also contains some very visible upgrades. You can read below for further details.</p>
<h2 id="Including-Meta-Data"><a href="#Including-Meta-Data" class="headerlink" title="Including Meta Data"></a>Including Meta Data</h2><p>While fetching your files, Uppy is now also able to supply some custom metadata to go along with them. So far, there are three components in place for that: Core API (<code>core:update-meta</code> event), <code>MetaData</code> plugin, and a new panel in Dashboard UI called File Card, which looks like this:</p>
<p><img alt="metadata dashboard UI, editing file name, future size and adding description" src="/images/blog/0.8/metadata-dashboard.jpg" class="border"></p>
<a id="more"></a>
<p>To summon this panel, all you have to do is click the edit button on the Dashboard:</p>
<p><img alt="metadata dashboard UI, editing file name, future size and adding description" src="/images/blog/0.8/uppy-dashboard-ui.jpg" class="border"></p>
<p>By default, the only active metadata field is <code>Name</code>. However, if you want to add other fields you can utilize our new and easy to use <code>MetaData</code> plugin:</p>
<figure class="highlight javascript"><table><tr><td class="code"><pre><div class="line"><span class="keyword">const</span> uppy = <span class="keyword">new</span> Uppy()</div><div class="line">  .use(Dashboard)</div><div class="line">  .use(MetaData, &#123;</div><div class="line">    <span class="attr">fields</span>: [</div><div class="line">      &#123; <span class="attr">id</span>: <span class="string">'resizeTo'</span>, <span class="attr">name</span>: <span class="string">'Resize to'</span>, <span class="attr">value</span>: <span class="number">1200</span>, <span class="attr">placeholder</span>: <span class="string">'specify future image size'</span> &#125;,</div><div class="line">      &#123; <span class="attr">id</span>: <span class="string">'description'</span>, <span class="attr">name</span>: <span class="string">'Description'</span>, <span class="attr">value</span>: <span class="string">''</span>, <span class="attr">placeholder</span>: <span class="string">'describe what the file is for'</span> &#125;</div><div class="line">    ]</div><div class="line">  &#125;)</div></pre></td></tr></table></figure>
<p>And just like that, we have added two fields: <code>Resize</code> and <code>Description</code>. All metadata is sent along with both <a href="http://tus.io" target="_blank" rel="external">tus</a> and multipart uploads.</p>
<h2 id="Webcam-Support"><a href="#Webcam-Support" class="headerlink" title="Webcam Support"></a>Webcam Support</h2><p>We have also added a basic <code>Webcam</code> plugin, which allows you to acquire images directly from your own webcam. This is still a work in progress and we will be improving it in the next release.</p>
<h2 id="Mime-Types-and-File-Icons"><a href="#Mime-Types-and-File-Icons" class="headerlink" title="Mime Types and File Icons"></a>Mime Types and File Icons</h2><p>Uppy now includes a <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/mime-types" target="_blank" rel="external">mime-type</a> library that helps us figure out file types by extension.</p>
<p>Having proper file types also means that we need the right corresponding file icons for the Dashboard UI. We have already added a few and we will soon supply more icons for audio, video, text, PDF and other common file types.</p>
<h2 id="Previously-on-Uppy-File-Previews-Remote-File-Handling-Accessibility-and-Acceptance-Tests-Stats"><a href="#Previously-on-Uppy-File-Previews-Remote-File-Handling-Accessibility-and-Acceptance-Tests-Stats" class="headerlink" title="Previously on Uppy: File Previews, Remote File Handling, Accessibility and Acceptance Tests Stats"></a>Previously on Uppy: File Previews, Remote File Handling, Accessibility and Acceptance Tests Stats</h2><p>We thought it might be worth taking a moment to list a few highlights from the previous versions as well:</p>
<ul>
<li>If a file you selected is an image, its preview thumbnail data URL will be generated and added to <code>file.preview</code> in Uppy‚Äôs state. This URL can be used later to render a preview with any plugin. Currently, this is done by the mighty Dashboard.</li>
<li>It is now also possible to select remote files in Uppy. Simply double-click a file from, for instance, Google Drive, and Uppy will then show it in a preview area.</li>
<li>We have been doing some more work on accessibility: from now on, when you switch tabs in Modal, it will focus on the first input in that tab. We have also added proper labels and titles, and are doing more research in this area.</li>
<li>Everybody likes to see stats. That is why, on our website, you can now <a href="http://uppy.io/stats">view stats</a> that show how acceptance tests are performing in various browsers. If a test is successful, that means Uppy will likely be able to load and upload files in that particular browser.</li>
<li>The Dashboard UI is now way better looking and easier to work with. It replaced the old <code>Modal</code> plugin and it can accept files via drag &amp; drop, local disk and paste (experimental, WIP). It has become our main source of truth and the basic acquire plugin for local files. The DragDrop plugin is still available as a lighter alternative.</li>
</ul>

    <title>Uppy: let‚Äôs teach an old dog some new¬†tricks</title>
    <link href="http://uppy.io/blog/2016/07/uppy-begins/"/>
    <id>http://uppy.io/blog/2016/07/uppy-begins/</id>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[<p>For the past six months, we have been working hard on uppy.io. We feel that it is high time we gave you a look behind the scenes: what are we working on, and why.</p>
<p><img src="/images/blog/uppy-begins/uppy-dashboard.jpg"></p>
<p>The way uploading works has not changed in a meaningful way since the days of our trusty old 56 kbit/s modems. Of course, files have gotten bigger and speeds have increased, but that is more or less all there is to say. If it were up to us ‚Äì and we hope it is ‚Äì that is all about to change.</p>
<p>We at <a href="https://transloadit.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Transloadit</a> are on a mission to change the way the world does uploading. To accomplish this, our first step has been to develop an open protocol for resumable file uploads, called <a href="http://tus.io/" target="_blank" rel="external">‚Äòtus‚Äô</a>. Finally, that 2GB video upload from your smartphone doesn‚Äôt have to start over when your train passes through a tunnel! The protocol got <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10591348" target="_blank" rel="external">Hacker News excited</a> on several occasions and is being deployed by, among others, our friends at Vimeo. Now that a stable version 1.0 of ‚Äòtus‚Äô has been released, it is time to put it to the test. A protocol without real-world applications is nothing more than a meaningless document, after all.</p>
<p>We are therefore excited to tell you about Uppy: the file uploader that will certainly fetch more than just your newspaper.</p>
<a id="more"></a>
<h2 id="Why-the-need-for-another-file-uploader"><a href="#Why-the-need-for-another-file-uploader" class="headerlink" title="Why the need for another file uploader?"></a>Why the need for another file uploader?</h2><p>It is true, there are indeed already a good few file uploading solutions out there (<a href="http://www.dropzonejs.com/" target="_blank" rel="external">Dropzone</a>, for instance, is quite good). And ‚Äì for the most part ‚Äì they do their job. Nevertheless, they are quite limited in their functionality:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>You can drag and drop files from local disk, but uploaders that supports Instagram, Dropbox or Google Drive are scarce. The ones out there lock you in with vendors and are hard to customize for own use.</p>
</li>
<li><p>File uploaders are seldom mindful of the existence of encoding and processing backends, while the reality is that files often require some form of processing and that the end user would like to receive progress updates with regard to that.</p>
</li>
<li><p>None of the currently available file uploaders make use of the standardized resumability that ‚Äòtus‚Äô provides, which makes them less than ideal for handling larger files.</p>
</li>
<li><p>Lastly, we feel that the current solutions are sometimes dropping the ball when it comes to a polished user experience. We aim to fix that.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>All in all, we think there is definitely some ‚Äòtrouble at the old mill‚Äô here and it‚Äôs time to let Uppy take care of that!</p>
<h2 id="Our-plans-for-Uppy"><a href="#Our-plans-for-Uppy" class="headerlink" title="Our plans for Uppy"></a>Our plans for Uppy</h2><p>Uppy will be a JavaScript file uploader that allows you to fetch files, not only from your local disk, but also from places like Dropbox, Instagram, Google Drive, webcams and remote URLs. It will have a modular, plugin-based design, making it lightweight and customizable.</p>
<p>Cute on the outside, the core of Uppy is very robust ‚Äì thanks to resumability through ‚Äòtus‚Äô. We are confident that Uppy will be able to send even the biggest of files over the smallest of tubes.</p>
<p>Uppy will also offer first class support for accessing Transloadit‚Äôs uploading and encoding backend, making it incredibly versatile. Of course, these are all ultimately just plugins, and Uppy can just as easily be used with your own backend ‚Äì meaning no need to pay any subscription fees.</p>
<p>We are intent on making the user experience as smooth and satisfying as possible, in terms of both functionality and visual design. Uppy will have a beautiful, themeable UI and it will look ‚Äì and work ‚Äì great on mobile platforms as well. While we hope that advanced users will love the customizable nature of Uppy, an ample selection of presets will also be there to make sure that novice users are not going to be lost in the woods.</p>
<p>Lastly, and this is a point of special significance to us, Uppy will be completely open source. When Uppy is finished, you will be free to use it for whatever you like. Until that time, we very much welcome your ideas and contributions. There are still a lot of decisions to be made and this is the perfect time to come and influence the end product.</p>
<p>We are going to work hard on bringing you the best file uploader possible and we‚Äôll keep you informed about the development process on <a href="http://uppy.io/">uppy.io</a>. We can‚Äôt wait for you to meet Uppy!</p>

<p>We were on the <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12109410" target="_blank" rel="external">Hacker News</a> and <a href="https://www.producthunt.com/posts/uppy" target="_blank" rel="external">Product Hunt</a> frontpages. Comments welcome there.</p>
